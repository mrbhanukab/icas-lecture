## About ICAS Webinar Series

The ICAS Webinar Series is a free astronomy webinar series organized by the Isipathana College Astronomy Society. The society is a team of students from Isipathana College in Sri Lanka and the webinar series was conducted during the years 2021-2023, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

The series aimed to educate and inspire astronomy enthusiasts in Sri Lanka, and featured three lectures: "Are we Alone?", "Life on Earth" and "The Flat Earth". The first lecture, "Are we Alone?" was conducted by Bhanuka Bandara (Vice President) and Kaveen Fernando (Secretary), while the second lecture, "Life on Earth", was conducted by Sathnidu Thamuditha (Past Vice President) and Vidusha Udukumbura (Treasurer & Organizer). Third lecture "The Flat Earth" was conducted by Movindu Lochana (President) and Kaveen Fernando (Secretary).

The webinar was conducted via Zoom, and registered participants received an WhatsApp massage with the Zoom meeting link and password. The ICAS Webinar Series team utilized various social media platforms to promote the event, including Facebook and Instagram.

Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the webinar series was a massive success, with participants from all over Sri Lanka joining in to learn about astronomy and related topics. The ICAS Webinar Series has become a beacon of hope and inspiration for astronomy enthusiasts in Sri Lanka, and the society hopes to continue conducting such events in the future.
